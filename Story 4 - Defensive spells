# Defensive spells
Defensive spells are called defensive for a reason:

Summoning a defensive spell protects the summoning wizard from the next attack.

But not all defensive spells are the same, some defensive spells like 'Stupify' cause the opponent to be paralysed therefore the opponent can't execute his next attack.

# Unforgivable curses

Unforgivable curses really are unforgivable.
Using any of these three curses on another human being, Muggle or wizard, would result in a life sentence to Azkaban.

But during this kata, we forgive you (kinda).
If you summon an unforgivable curse you just scar your own soul and lose a little HP.

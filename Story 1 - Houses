# Houses
As you know (or should know!), every wizard at hogwarts gets assigned to a house.
As a first year wizard at Hogwarts, the sorting hat will decide in which house you'll belong.

The houses are as follows:
* Gryffindor
* Slytherin
* Hufflepuff
* Ravenclaw


<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Implement a sorting hat that will randomly sort wizards in a house when creating a wizardly wizard.
Try to have some feedback from the sorting hat as well like this:
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, who do we have here?
<br/>
Ah, I see, it's nameWizard
<br/>
Where shall we put you...
<br/>
Oh, I know...
<br/>
OK nameWizard, I'll put you in ... SLYTHERIN!
